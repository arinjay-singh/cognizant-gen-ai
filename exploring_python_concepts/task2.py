# Assignment: Exploring Python Concepts
# Task 2 - Operators: Playing with Numbers

# set values for two numbers
num1 = 10
num2 = 5

# perform arithmetic operations
addition = num1 + num2
subtraction = num1 - num2
multiplication = num1 * num2
division = num1 / num2

# Print the results of the operations
print(f'The sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {addition}')
print(f'The difference when {num2} is subtracted from {num1} is: {subtraction}')
print(f'The product of {num1} and {num2} is: {multiplication}')
print(f'The result of dividing {num1} by {num2} is: {division}')
